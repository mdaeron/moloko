This is just an exploratory exercise to deploy a [streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app with arbitrarily complex dependencies using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) magic.

To test it, [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation) and try

```
uvx git+https://github.com/mdaeron/moloko
```
